## Description

Long, long ago (like... Block 42), a wizard sealed 1 ETH inside a mystical Proxy Contract. 

You get one shot to proxy upgrade it—but under these very strict rules: 

No Messing with the Family Tree 
The inheritance structure stays exactly as is. No new parents, no secret children. 

No Rewriting the Magic 
You can’t alter existing functions or their visibility, and you can’t add or remove any functions. No new spells, no banished spells. 

No Rearranging the Royal Closet. 
The storage layout cannot change. Touch a single uint256, and you might awaken the alignment demon. 

No Upgrading the Wizard’s Quill 
Keep the same Solidity version. The wizard likes his dusty old version—deal with it. 

Obey these ancient laws, upgrade the contract once, and claim the 100 ETH prize. But break them and face the dreaded 'Gasless Abyss!'
